# himawari-downloader
Python script to download and merge the latest Himawari-8 image chunks. 

Code borrows from other himawari downloaders, mostly [Michael Pote's PS script](https://gist.github.com/MichaelPote/92fa6e65eacf26219022), https://github.com/jakiestfu/himawari.js/, and https://github.com/domoritz/himawari-8-chrome/

Requires:
* Python 3.2+ probably (I used 3.6, but I think the threadexecutor is 3.2)
* Pillow `pip install pillow`
